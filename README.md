The Executive Language  

Working on writing an interpreted language in Rust, for fun I guess. Nothing overly difficult, but it exists I guess.  
Haven't used Rust before, but looks interesting, so I'm learning it as I go.

Syntax
```
str var_one = "Hello"
println(var_one " World!")
```
Prints out `Hello World!`. To print out both text and variables, you just need to have a space between the variable and the quotes, and it'll handle itself.  
Currently has `int` `str` `bool` `char` data types
